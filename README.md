# UltraStar Song Downloader

This repository has a basic script that goes through each folder in a song folder for USDX

The folder names have the naming convention `Artist Name - Song Name` that it will use for the text file reading.

## Installation

This file requires the following 3rd party modules:

- PyTube

The folder to install it to is the root folder of your UltraStar Deluxe Songs folder and run the file.

## Intended Usage

- This is intended to obtain videos for songs obtained from USDB [usdb.animux.de].

## Limitations:

- YouTube downloads are only limited to your region, any unavailable videos are unavailable to the downloader as well.
- There's currently no folder tracking but it does skip already downloading videos that already exist in the folder.
